# Privacy guardrails

## Red lines
- Do not collect or store (especially on-chain):
  - other people's names, photos, handles, phone numbers, addresses
  - chat transcripts
  - URLs that point to a specific profile
  - identifiers that can be used to re-identify someone

## UX controls
- Warnings when user attempts to paste obvious PII patterns (phone/email).
- Default "private notes" mode.
- Export flow includes a checklist: *"This package must not contain third-party PII."*

## Compliance posture (MVP)
- Data stays on device by default.
- User controls exports.
- No backend processing.
