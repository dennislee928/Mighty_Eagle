# Security Policy

## Supported versions
This is an MVP template. Security hardening is required before production use.

## Reporting a vulnerability
Please do **not** open public issues for vulnerabilities.
Instead, create a private report with:
- Impact
- Reproduction steps
- Suggested remediation

## Safety constraints (non-negotiable)
- No on-chain PII
- No harvesting/collection of third-party data without consent
- No guidance or implementation for bypassing platform enforcement
